## TO RUN THE CODE


"runme.sh" is a shell script used to compile, run, and launch the gnuplots scripts.

Be sure to have a "results" folder and also a "plots" folder from where you launch the "runme.sh" .
Clearly also the gnuplotscripts folder must be present, and gnuplot must be installed on your machine.
